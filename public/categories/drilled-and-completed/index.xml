      <description>Overview of EIA DUC Inventory ReportA drilled but uncompleted well (DUC) is a new well after the end of the drilling process, but its first completion process has not been concluded.EIA uses 20 days to estimate days to TD. This likely overestimates DUC inventory in basins where PAD drilling is predominant.Report tracks monthly changes in DUC inventory beginning in 2014.Permian Monthly HighlightsPermian Basin ended February with ~3,044 wells waiting on completion.</description>
