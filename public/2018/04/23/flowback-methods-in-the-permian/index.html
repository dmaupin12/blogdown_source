<h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Analyze completion filings obtained from NMOCD and data from IHS to gain a better understanding of flowback strategies by our peers.</li>
<li>Completion data is from 2017-Current.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="highlights" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Highlights</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Many companies in the Northern Delaware are flowing up <strong>4<sup>1/2</sup> - 5<sup>1/2</sup></strong> casing.
<ul>
<li>On the Texas side of the NMTX border, <strong>RSP</strong> is also utilizing <strong>4<sup>1/2</sup></strong> casing during flowback.</li>
<li>Further South, <strong>Resolute</strong> and <strong>Carrizo</strong> are using the same method as RSP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>EOG</strong> and <strong>Oxy</strong> are leading edge with many wells initially flowing over <strong>10,000 Bbls/d.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oxyâ€™s <strong>Cedar Canyon 27-28</strong> had an IP of over <strong>18,000 Bbbl/d.</strong> The well has produced over <strong>800,000 bbls</strong> in just two months (Jan-Feb 2018).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Companies are using chokes to limit produced volumes up casing.</li>
<li><strong>Mewbourne</strong> appears to prefer total fluid volumes below <strong>5,000 Bbls/d.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Every well except for one is flowing up 4<sup>1/2</sup> casing.</li>
<li>Choke sizes range of sizes are from 12/64-41/64.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Near North Harpoon, <strong>PDC Energy</strong> flowed multiple wells up <strong>5<sup>1/2</sup></strong> casing with the highest well achieving <strong>9,000 Bbls/d.</strong></li>
<li>In the Midland Basin, Laredo, Exxon and Apache had mutltiple wells flowing up casing, although prefered method is still flowing up tubing.</li>
</ul>
