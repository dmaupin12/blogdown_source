<div id="methodology" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Methodology</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Analyze completion filings obtained from NMOCD to gain a better understanding of flowback strategies by our peers.</li>
<li>Operators included in the dataset are Concho, Centennial, Devon, EOG, Matador, Mewbourne and Oxy.</li>
<li>Completion data is from 2017-Current.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="highlights" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Highlights</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Many of our peers are flowing up casing…not just EOG.</li>
<li>Choke size appears to be highly coorelated to fluid volumes.</li>
<li>Althougth Mewboune’s wells are flowing up casing, they are choking their wells back considerably. Range of sizes are from 12/64“-30/64”.</li>
<li>Also, Oxy’s Cedar Canyon has produced over 800K barrels of fluid in just two months (Jan-Feb 2018), I had to triple check that figure.</li>
