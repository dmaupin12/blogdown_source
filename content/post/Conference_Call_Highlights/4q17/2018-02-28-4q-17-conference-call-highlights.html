<div id="halliburton" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Halliburton</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Total company revenue was <strong>$5.9 billion</strong>, representing a <strong>9% increase</strong> from 3Q’17.</li>
<li>North American revenue was up <strong>~7%</strong> sequentially. Improvement was driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States.</li>
<li>Highlighted select technology:
<ul>
<li><strong>Geometrix 4D Shaped Cutters</strong> - Improve cutting efficiency and increase control to reduce drilling costs.</li>
<li><strong>JetPulse</strong> - Provides high speed data transmission of drilling and formation evaluation measures.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Sentry</strong> - Device providing pressure control solutions by creating a seal around the drill string and tool joints for safer containment of fluids.</li>
<li><strong>BaraShale</strong> - Water-based fluid designed to maintain full salt saturation with reduced density, which should help prevent lost circulation and minimize disposal costs.</li>
<li><strong>Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer</strong> - Allows operators to pinpoint casing defect and metal corrosion in up to five tubular strings within the well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have seen cost inflation in sand and trucking. Price of sand has escalated over the last few months of 2017. However, <strong>increased sand supply</strong> from localized mines should <strong>reduce costs in 2018.</strong></li>
<li>Completions market remains tight and is <strong>currently sold out</strong>; will <strong>continue to push pricing</strong> throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>Rig to frac spread ratio is ~2:1</strong>. During the oil price decline, the spread rose to as high as ~4:1.
<ul>
<li>Industry horsepower is working harder, which is increasing pace of degradation on equipment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Believe price inflation could be <strong>higher than 15%</strong> in 2018. <br> <br></li>
