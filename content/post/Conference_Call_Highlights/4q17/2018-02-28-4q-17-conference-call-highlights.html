<div id="halliburton" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Halliburton</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Total company revenue was <strong>$5.9 billion</strong>, representing a <strong>9% increase</strong> from 3Q’17.</li>
<li>North American revenue was up <strong>~7%</strong> sequentially. Improvement was driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States.</li>
<li>Highlighted select technology:
<ul>
<li><strong>Geometrix 4D Shaped Cutters</strong> - Improve cutting efficiency and increase control to reduce drilling costs.</li>
<li><strong>JetPulse</strong> - Provides high speed data transmission of drilling and formation evaluation measures.</li>
<li><strong>Marine Sentry</strong> - Device providing pressure control solutions by creating a seal around the drill string and tool joints for safer containment of fluids.</li>
<li><strong>BaraShale</strong> - Water-based fluid designed to maintain full salt saturation with reduced density, which should help prevent lost circulation and minimize disposal costs.</li>
<li><strong>Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer</strong> - Allows operators to pinpoint casing defect and metal corrosion in up to five tubular strings within the well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have seen cost inflation in sand and trucking. Price of sand has escalated over the last few months of 2017. However, <strong>increased sand supply</strong> from localized mines should <strong>reduce costs in 2018.</strong></li>
<li>Completions market remains tight and is <strong>currently sold out</strong>; will <strong>continue to push pricing</strong> throughout the year.</li>
<li><strong>Rig to frac spread ratio is ~2:1</strong>. During the oil price decline, the spread rose to as high as ~4:1.
<ul>
<li>Industry horsepower is working harder, which is increasing pace of degradation on equipment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Believe price inflation could be <strong>higher than 15%</strong> in 2018. <br> <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="helmerich-and-payne" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Helmerich and Payne</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Average spot pricing still in the <strong>high-teens,</strong> while leading edge <strong>Super-Spec</strong> FlexRig pricing is in the <strong>low-to-mid $20s.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Super-Spec</strong> rigs include AC drive with 1,500 hp drawworks, 750,000# hookload ratings, 7,500 psi mud circulating systems and multiple well pad drilling systems. <img style="float: right;" src="/img/4q17/hp_superspec.png"></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Industry is transitioning to Super-Spec rigs as the market share has increased from ~34% to <strong>~40%</strong> in 7 months.<br />
</li>
<li>Company has <strong>102 rigs</strong> contracted in the Permian. Represents ~50% of total company contracts.</li>
<li>As of January 2018, over <strong>70%</strong> of total horizontal activity is utilizing <strong>AC Drive</strong> rigs.</li>
<li>Highlighted MOTIVE and MagVAR capabilities:
<ul>
<li>MOTIVE: Bit guidance system which has been used on more than 350 horizontal wells to date. Allows for more accurate well placement, smoother wellbores, more efficient drilling with consistently lower well costs.
<ul>
<li>Eagle Ford case study: 2 sets of 4 wells (one guided by MOTIVE and one without), with nearly identical lithologies, well paths etc. MOTIVE provided <strong>30% lower effective drilling cost</strong> with nearly <strong>twice the accuracy</strong> and <strong>zero non-productive time.</strong> <br> <br></li>

<li>Implemented <strong>extended flow back</strong> program on <strong>30 wells</strong> across its acreage footprint with results <strong>exceeding 2017 Wolfcamp A</strong> type curve by <strong>25%.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Seeing increased gains on unconstrained flowback due to buildout of oil treating facilities.</li>
<li>By YE18, Anadarko midstream and Western Gas plan to place into service an additional <strong>400 MMcf/d</strong> of gas processing and <strong>120 Mbo/d</strong> of oil treating capacity.</li>

<li>Going all in on Alpine High, divested Canadian assets and multiple small divestitures in the Midland and Delaware Basins during 2017.
<ul>
<li>Eagle Ford acreage is on the market.</li>
<li>Oklahoma assets probable divestiture candidates as well given minimal capital allocated to region.</li>
<li><strong>Outside of Alpine High, Permian production is expected to be relatively flat through 2020.</strong></li>
<li><em>Read through: Given the significant amount of capital deployed to Alpine High, certain Permian assets could be acquired (assuming their attractive) at reasonble prices.</em><br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>2018 CAPEX is <strong>~$3.0 billion,</strong> 40% will be spent in Alpine High.

</ul></li>
<li><p>Well results outside of Alpine High include <strong>3 pads</strong> in the <strong>Midland Basin</strong>, <strong>7 wells</strong> in <strong>Dixieland</strong> and <strong>5 wells</strong> on the <strong>New Mexico Shelf.</strong> <img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="/img/4q17/apa_wells.png"/> <br></p></li>
<li>Management answered multiple questions during the call regarding the trade discount at Waha. They expect a combination of the <strong>Kinder Gulf Coast Express Pipeline</strong> (2019 completion date) and macro-economic factors related to Mexico and the West Coast should alleviate a significant portion of the discount.</li>
<li><p>Established additional management target ratios in annual compensation plan which include a CROIC target of <strong>18%</strong> and ROCE at <em>“sustainable double-digits”</em> <br> <br></p></li>

<li>Similar to last quarter’s report, the company highlighted its <strong>permitting strategy,</strong> which has led to expedited approval for future drilling activity.

<li>7 of its 10 MDPs have been submitted to regulatory agencies. MDPs are designed to accommodate <strong>~1,600 drilling permits.</strong></li>
<li>4 MDPs have been approved.</li>
<li>Management provided commentary on the permitting process stating, <em>“the overall plan is so that we can get permits not just on subsurface, but surface right-of-way, takeaway, battery, et cetera. So what we can do is cover the NEPA, the surface area all at one time. In doing this, it helps the BLM to be able to do more permits in a timely manner. So we work very closely with them, have a very good relationship. Once you have that approved, it then works on to the APD. Upon approval, the commitment from the BLM by statute is 30 days as after we get those approved.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Current acreage in the Delaware is <strong>~300,000 acres</strong>, and about 90% is located in New Mexico.</li>
