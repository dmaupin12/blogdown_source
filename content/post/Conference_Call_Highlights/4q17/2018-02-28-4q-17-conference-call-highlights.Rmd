###**Service Companies**
<br>

####**Halliburton**

* Total company revenue was **$5.9 billion**, representing a **9% increase** from 3Q'17.
* North American revenue was up **~7%** sequentially. Improvement was driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States.
* Highlighted select technology:
    + **Geometrix 4D Shaped Cutters** - Improve cutting efficiency and increase control to reduce drilling costs.
    + **JetPulse** - Provides high speed data transmission of drilling and formation evaluation measures.
    + **Marine Sentry** - Device providing pressure control solutions by creating a seal around the drill string and tool joints for safer containment of fluids.
    + **BaraShale** - Water-based fluid designed to maintain full salt saturation with reduced density, which should help prevent lost circulation and minimize disposal costs.
    + **Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer** - Allows operators to pinpoint casing defect and metal corrosion in up to five tubular strings within the well.
* Have seen cost inflation in sand and trucking. Price of sand has escalated over the last few months of 2017. However, **increased sand supply** from localized mines should **reduce costs in 2018.**
* Completions market remains tight and is **currently sold out**; will **continue to push pricing** throughout the year.
* **Rig to frac spread ratio is ~2:1**. During the oil price decline, the spread rose to as high as ~4:1. 
    + Industry horsepower is working harder, which is increasing pace of degradation on equipment.
* Believe price inflation could be **higher than 15%** in 2018.
<br>
<br>

####**Helmerich and Payne**

* Average spot pricing still in the **high-teens,** while leading edge **Super-Spec** FlexRig pricing is in the **low-to-mid $20s.**
    + **Super-Spec** rigs include AC drive with 1,500 hp drawworks, 750,000# hookload ratings, 7,500 psi mud circulating systems and multiple well pad drilling systems. 
<img style="float: right;" src="/img/4q17/hp_superspec.png">

* Industry is transitioning to Super-Spec rigs as the market share has increased from ~34% to **~40%** in 7 months.  
* Company has **102 rigs** contracted in the Permian. Represents ~50% of total company contracts.
* As of January 2018, over **70%** of total horizontal activity is utilizing **AC Drive** rigs.
* Highlighted MOTIVE and MagVAR capabilities:
    + MOTIVE: Bit guidance system which has been used on more than 350 horizontal wells to date. Allows for more accurate well placement, smoother wellbores, more efficient drilling with consistently lower well costs.
        + Eagle Ford case study: 2 sets of 4 wells (one guided by MOTIVE and one without), with nearly identical lithologies, well paths etc. MOTIVE provided **30% lower effective drilling cost** with nearly **twice the accuracy** and **zero non-productive time.**
<br>
<br>

    + 4 MDPs have been approved.
    + Management provided commentary on the permitting process stating, *"the overall plan is so that we can get permits not just on subsurface, but surface right-of-way, takeaway, battery, et cetera. So what we can do is cover the NEPA, the surface area all at one time. In doing this, it helps the BLM to be able to do more permits in a timely manner. So we work very closely with them, have a very good relationship. Once you have that approved, it then works on to the APD. Upon approval, the commitment from the BLM by statute is 30 days as after we get those approved."*

* In the Greater Sand Dunes Region, PoP'd the **Patton MDP1 18 Fed23H** which is an **Avalon** appraisal well that had an **IP30** of **1,509 Be/d** (76% oil).
* Also in the Greater Sand Dunes Region, testing new frac designs and should have results in early 2018.
* In the Midland Basin, operating expenses in Merchant averaged **~$2.71** in 2017 driven largely by centralized facilities, no water hauling and using gas lift which has limited well failures and downhole costs.
* Big data analytics *(buzz buzz)* reducing workovers through early detection of problems in artificial lifts and drilling.
