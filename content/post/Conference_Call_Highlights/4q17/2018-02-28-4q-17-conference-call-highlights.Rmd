###**Service Companies**
<br>

####**Halliburton**

* Total company revenue was **$5.9 billion**, representing a **9% increase** from 3Q'17.
* North American revenue was up **~7%** sequentially. Improvement was driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States.
* Highlighted select technology:
    + **Geometrix 4D Shaped Cutters** - Improve cutting efficiency and increase control to reduce drilling costs.
    + **JetPulse** - Provides high speed data transmission of drilling and formation evaluation measures.
    + **Marine Sentry** - Device providing pressure control solutions by creating a seal around the drill string and tool joints for safer containment of fluids.
    + **BaraShale** - Water-based fluid designed to maintain full salt saturation with reduced density, which should help prevent lost circulation and minimize disposal costs.
    + **Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer** - Allows operators to pinpoint casing defect and metal corrosion in up to five tubular strings within the well.
* Have seen cost inflation in sand and trucking. Price of sand has escalated over the last few months of 2017. However, **increased sand supply** from localized mines should **reduce costs in 2018.**
* Completions market remains tight and is **currently sold out**; will **continue to push pricing** throughout the year.
* **Rig to frac spread ratio is ~2:1**. During the oil price decline, the spread rose to as high as ~4:1. 
    + Industry horsepower is working harder, which is increasing pace of degradation on equipment.
* Believe price inflation could be **higher than 15%** in 2018.
