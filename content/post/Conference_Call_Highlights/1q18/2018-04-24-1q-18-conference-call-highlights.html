<div id="baker-hughes" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Baker Hughes</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>See global oil demand rising at a steady pace driven by improved GDP outlook in the United States and Europe.
<ul>
<li>Prices should be relatively range bound in 2018.</li>
<li>Offshore markets remain below historic activity levels.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drilled a <strong>20,000’ foot horizontal</strong> in the Marcellus Basin in just <strong>8 days.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Annual Report Highlights:</strong> In 2017, the <strong>TerrAdapt bit</strong> was introduced to the industry as the first adaptive drill bit that adjusts to downhole conditions autonomously to enable smoother, faster drilling and extended tool life. <br> <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="halliburton" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Halliburton</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Total company revenue was <strong>$5.7 billion</strong>, representing a <strong>3% decrease</strong> from 4Q’17.</li>
<li>Although revenue was impacted by delays in sand delivery due to weather related rail interruptions, North American revenue was up <strong>~$3.5 billion</strong>, or <strong>3.4%</strong> from the previous quarter.</li>
<li>2018 CAPEX spend is expected to be <strong>~$2 billion.</strong></li>
<li>Pressure pumping market remains tight; company achieved a new record for stages per frac fleet in March.</li>
<li>Although incremental horsepower has hit the market, undersupply is expected to persist due to degradation of existing equipment. <strong><em>“About 50% of announced horsepower does not translate into new crews. This means that about half the new build equipment is being used to replace or add to crews already in the field.”</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Market undersupply is ~1-1.5 million horsepower per day. Do not foresee any major increases in supply due to attrition of equipment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Halliburton views <strong>trucking, labor and rail</strong> as three significant areas of supply chain tightness.</li>
<li>North America’s role in the global supply has shifted from a swing producer to baseload supplier to meet growing global demand.
<ul>
<li>Many customers have redeployed capital from international non-OPEC opportunities to North America (CVX, XOM, APC, APA etc.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company is close to achieving normalized margins, defined as <strong>~20%,</strong> which hasn’t happened since 2014.</li>
<li>Technology Update:
<ul>
<li><strong>CoreVault</strong> - First and only wireline rotary sidewall coring system that captures and preserves both reservoir rock and fluid samples. Operator in the Permian confirmed a <strong>six-fold increase in recorded pressure</strong> as compared to previous tools deployed in the field.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>International market pricing continues to shift down, but see inflection point in 2019 from increases in bidding activity.</li>
<li>Other events: Halliburton wrote down all of its remaining assets ($312 million) in Venezuela due to ongoing political and economic challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Annual Report Highlights:</strong> See substantial growth in the North American market with increased commodity prices, a surge in unconventional activity and a continuation of the Completions and Production pricing recovery that began in 2017. Company expects production segement to grow largely through the recent acquistion of Summit ESP in 2017, which made Halliburton the second largest ESP provider in North America. <br> <br></li>
</ul>

<div id="superior-energy-services" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Superior Energy Services</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>In the U.S. Onshore market, revenue totaled <strong>$331.4 million</strong> which was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter.
<ul>
<li>Frac utilization was challenged by weather and shortages of frac sand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Increasing trend of customers self-sourcing sand; around 70% of frac jobs will have customer-supplied proppant.</li>
<li>Similar to Halliburton, company <strong>reiterated lack of investment in pressure pumping</strong> over the past few years will keep <strong>supply/demand balance fairly tight.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Forecast pricing and utilization in 2019 to be on trend with 2018.</li>
<li>Adding <strong>150,000 horsepower,</strong> or <strong>three fleets</strong> in the second quarter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fleets are averaging <strong>~$15 million</strong> in EBITDA per quarter. <strong>At current margins, will not invest in new builds.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Need more clarity of what 2020,2021 and 2022 look like before thinking about expansion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Completely sold out of 4<sup>1/2</sup> drill pipe</strong> and seeing <strong>increased demand in 5 <sup>1/2</sup> drill pipe</strong> used in longer laterals. <br> <br></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="us-silica" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>US Silica</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Oil and Gas revenue totaled <strong>$312.9 million,</strong> up <strong>2%</strong> from the fourth quarter.</li>
<li><strong>67% of sand was sold in basin</strong> compared to 62% sold in basin last quarter.</li>
<li>2018 CAPEX is expected to be between <strong>$300-$350 million.</strong></li>
<li>Guiding second quarter sand volumes to increase by <strong>10%-15%</strong> and spot pricing to increase at <strong>mid-single digit rates.</strong></li>
<li>First rail line at the <strong>Crane County facility</strong> started up during the quarter. The current run rate is ~500 tons per year or about <strong>50%</strong> of permitted capacity.
<ul>
<li>Production rate should ramp up to <strong>1 million tons per year</strong> in the second quarter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lamesa facility</strong> is behind originally planned start-up timeline.
<ul>
<li>On track to produce wet tons in June, with drying commencing in the third quarter, and ramping to full capacity of <strong>2.6 million tons per year</strong> by the end of 2018.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company believes Permian Basin local sand production will come online much slower than many predict, and further, that demand will grow much faster than our industry can bring on capacity.
<ul>
<li><strong>Market should remain tight through 2019.</strong></li>
<li><strong><em>We’re completely sold out of sand. We’re literally selling everything we can make.</em></strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Noted supply could be hampered by flooding on the Mississippi, where barges have been unable to haul freight downstream.
<ul>
<li><em>Read through: The is the first time I’ve seen supply constraint issues mentioned due to delays in barge shipments; Yet another hiccup that exacerbates an already tight supply/demand market.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Continue to see strong demand for Northern White and regional local sand.
<ul>
<li>Permian receives <strong>~45%-50%</strong> of sand.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Large customer in the Permian is switching back to Northern White due to the quality of the regional sand.</strong> <br></li>

<ul>
<li>Permian Basin production averaged <strong>30.9 Mboe/d,</strong> up <strong>~10%</strong> sequentially.</li>
<li>Guiding 2018 production to average between <strong>38.1-40.5 Mboe/d,</strong> an increase of <strong>~75%</strong> from the 2017 average.
<ul>
<li>Increased guidance slightly from February announcement due to efficiency gains in drill times and a step-change in number of frac stages completed each month.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Placed <strong>31</strong> net wells online compared to the original plan of 18 net wells.
<ul>
<li>Wells were completed on two separate projects, the <strong>Peeler Pad (9 wells)</strong> had an average lateral length of <strong>8,277’</strong> and the <strong>Act Pad (22 wells targeting 5 horizons)</strong> which was designed to test <strong>44 wells per section</strong> had an average lateral length of <strong>9,351’.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Company stated a few <strong>Dean</strong> wells were completed in what was originally thought to be a frac barrier.
<ul>
<li>Recent observations from tests revealed that the <strong>Spraberry Shale</strong> and <strong>Upper Wolfcamp</strong> both appear to be <strong>influenced by the the Dean.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The two projects each cover a half section,</strong> which can be seen from the map below.</li>
<li>The Charts illustrate lateral diagrams for both projects.
<ul>
