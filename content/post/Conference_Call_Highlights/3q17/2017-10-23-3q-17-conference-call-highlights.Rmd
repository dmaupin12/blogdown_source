* Total sand volume in the third quarter increased compared to the previous quarter; however **proppant per foot remained sequentially flat.**
* Halliburton believes market is currently under supplied for pressure pumping equipment, while at the same time, equipment is being run harder and maintenance costs are higher. This will push the supply/demand balance out further than what most people think.
* Believe $50 oil will drive significant activity. 
* Forward pricing trajectory has flattened compared to previous quarter, as oil prices dipped back into the $40s.

* Began **simultaneously fracking** two 2-well pads, which **reduced downtime to offset producers** and **increased complexity/efficiency of stimulations.**
  + *"We've observed a tangible benefit from this approach, and we'll look to pair our frac crews where possible going forward."*
* Completed 6 wells with higher percentage of **100 mesh sand** with ***"outstanding results."***

* Spanish Trail 347 Wolfcamp A wells spaced at **8 wells per section** were frac'd with **100% 100 mesh.**
    + After **75 days of production**, wells have produced on average of **100,000 Boe.**
* **On the west side of the basin, the Wolfcamp A has been a suprise for the company.**
    + Experimenting with different landing zones within the formation.
* Implementing **gas lift pilots** in different areas and reservoirs.
    + Results have been **positive**; plan on increasing usage which will lower LOE.
* Plans for 2018 include running 4 rigs on average, drilling almost entirely in full development mode.
    + Begin **Glass Ranch** development in Martin County where company has higher NRIs (77%-80% NRI).
    + Continue full field development on **West Side** area after positive step-out results in the **Wolfcamp A.**

**Delaware Basin Results**
<img style="float: right;" src="/img/3q17/rsp_dmb2.png">

* Completed first **3^rd^ Bone Spring** on southern end of acreage.
    + **Rudd Draw 29 03 01H** completed with a 4,400' lateral and is **currently producing ~1,822 Boe/d** (73% oil), still cleaning up at >2,500 psi.
* **Going forward, 3^rd^ Bone Spring may need to be completed in tandem with the Wolfcamp A.** 
* Still in early stages of optimizing frac design.
* Evaluating cost/benefits of modified casing design.
    + Had casing issues with wells drilled by previous operator.
    + Mitigated issues by running tieback frac strings on subsequent well with similar casing design.
    + Testing upsized casing on 3-well program.
* In 2018, plan on running 3 rigs minimum with a majority of drilling on multi-well pads.
    + Previously ~40%, going forward ~85%.
* Dedicate 1 rig to **Rudd Draw** area; recent well results have been **highly prolific.**
    + **Rudd Draw 26 21 XY** completed with a 6,700' lateral has produced **450,000 Boe (73% oil) in 275 days.**
* Main target will continue to be **Wolfcamp A** pending further results from **Bone Spring** and **Wolfcamp B.**
* Analyzing 3D seismic, 
* Highlighted seismic data going West to East across acreage block, confirming CBP is East of company's Winkler County acreage.
    + Saw very little complexity in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring across acreage.
    + Eastern portion of acreage shows high quality rock with consistent presence of thick Wolfcamp and Bone Spring section.

<img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="/img/3q17/rsp_seismic2.png"/>

* *"Initial acquisition had a minimal amount of locations, so anything good that happens in Winkler County will have a substantial uplift for us."*
* Corporate: Do not foresee paying a dividend with the amount of inventory on hand at high rates of return.
* Currently have **~48%** of oil hedged at an average price of **$46.68** based on 30% production growth in 2018.

####**SM Energy**

* Currently running **7 rigs** and **4 frac crews** in the Midland Basin.
    + Plan on adding additional rig by year end.
* Completed 23 wells during the quarter.
* Announced results from **7 Wolfcamp As** and **1 Wolfcamp B** completion. **Wolfcamp A** wells were **horizontally spaced at 420'.**
<img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="/img/3q17/eca_comp2.png"/>

* Currently **drilling at an average rate of 1,100' per day**, up ~14% from the second quarter.
* Acquired **~5,000 net acres** year-to-date, company now has ~89,000 net acres in the Midland Basin.

<br>

####**WPX Energy**

* Averaged **7 rigs**  and **2 frac crews** during the quarter.
    + Plan on dropping 1 rig in the fourth quarter.
* Expect to exit 2017 with **20-25 DUCs.** 
* Announced results from **Lindsay 10-15 6 well pad** which was completed in the **Wolfcamp A**: 5 of the wells had 7,500' laterals and achieved an **IP30** average of **3,100 Boe/d** (~54% oil).
* In 2018, about **75% of the wells** will be **1.5 mile or 2 mile laterals.** The average lateral length will be about **8,000'**, which is **30% more** than the average in 2017.
* Current frac design is **~2,500 lbs/ft.**
* Focus in Delaware Basin will be first in State Line area, then in Central Reeves. Watching offset operators in Eddy County. 
* **See opportunity to divest non-core Delaware acreage in the near future.**
* Primary target in 2018 will be the **Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A;** less variability in well design should increase efficiencies.
* Seeing some service cost inflation.
* Closed previously announced midstream agreement, received $349 million from Howard Energy.
* Signed PSA to sell San Juan Basin dry gas holdings for $169 million.
